        The wikipedia's [__Random article__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random) button may be used but the articles may be less interesting.
         
        Each turn a guesser is chosen, whose job will be to find the one player telling the truth.   
        Also each turn an article is picked, from the pool of everyone's submitted articles.
         
        Only the person who submitted the article will be able to tell the truth about the chosen article, as they
        have chosen it and (hopefully) read about it so they can describe it to the guesser.
        The other players however do not know anything about the article and will have to convince the guesser
        that they do, by coming up with plausible sounding explanations, stories and facts about the chosen word.
        
        After the guesser has listened to everyone's attempts at convincing them of their truth, the guesser has
        to pick a player who they think is telling the truth and is the owner of the article.
        If they guess correctly, they are awarded a point. Otherwise the person who fooled the guesser gets a point."""
